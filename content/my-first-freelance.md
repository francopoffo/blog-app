# About

This is my first professional project. A landing page for a lawyer in Brazil.

The project was made using several features from [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):

- file-base routing
- static props generation
- performance features like next/image and next/script
- SEO performance with Head component and \_document.js

Other:

- CSS modules and React Icons for styling
- Firebase for storing data
- Google tag added to sync the page with Google Ads

## If you wanna check out how I did it

Download the code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/francopoffo/victoria-landpage)

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
